## Description

This project leverages Machine Learning to predict oil well failures, enabling proactive maintenance and optimizing operational efficiency. Our model accurately identifies potential failures well in advance, leading to significant cost savings and increased production. Approximately 10 years of historical data was analized. 

## Key Findings

- **Early Detection:** The model detects potential failures well in advance, enabling timely interventions.
- **Accurate Predictions:** XGBoost Alghorithm achieves an accuracy of 92% in identifying potential failures.
- **Feature Importance:** Highlighted key factors influencing well failures, including total fluid rate, fluid level, and BSW.

## Methodology

Approach: The CRISP-DM framework was utilized for a structured approach. 

1. **Data Collection:** Gathered historical data on well performance, including production rates, fluid levels, and laboratory results.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed data to ensure quality and consistency. Anonymization techniques were employed to protect sensitive information.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Extracted relevant features to enhance model performance.
4. **Model Selection and Training:** An XGBoost model was trained using grid search to optimize hyperparameters, outperforming other machine learning algorithms evaluated in this study.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Future Work

- Explore additional features and data sources.
- Implement anomaly detection techniques.
- Evaluate other machine learning algorithms.
